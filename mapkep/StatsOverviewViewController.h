//  This is where it would be very easy to get carried

//  Version one, I just want it telling me totals, and
//  the previous occurence date/time (or last two or
//  three depending on UI constraints).  No details at
//  all yet.  That'll be the first thing I do in the
//  next release.  In fact, I'm adding a "TODO" (as I
//  actually search for those before doing anything else
//  when I come back to a project, because I push the
//  green button often.  Now, what was I saying?  Ah yes,
//  a "TODO" so I know what I really want to do next.
//
//
//  TODO: Add stat details page next, just all dates/times
//      whelp.. I didn't stick to this for this TODO.  I got
//          carried away with creating this GitHub-esque view
